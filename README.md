##Code

In jQuery we often use the `$` and the `document` object is less useful. We can also use `console.log`.

* 3 backticks show as standard - if you type Javascript next to the ticks it will highlight as it usually would

```javascript
 const helloWorld = function () {
   console.log("Hello World!");
 }
```

```
 const helloWorld = function () {
   console.log("Hello World!");
 }
```
